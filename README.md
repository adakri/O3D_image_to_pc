## o3d_png_converter: generatig surface point clouds from images


Sometimes, when doing modelling or simulation, one needs to put colored surfaces on 3D flat surfaces. Images are usually used to generate textured surfaces, but there is not a tool to do this automatocally. This repository tries to solve this problem using the Open3D librairy for point cloud processing.
